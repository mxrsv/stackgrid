# DESIGN-LANGUAGE — Stackgrid chrome

Canonical rulebook for all **chrome UI** (settings panel, and — as they are
reworked — tab bar, status bar, pane bar, search bar, overlays). The settings
panel is the reference implementation. Extends `UX-DESIGN.md` §1; **where the
two conflict, this document wins** (known supersede: no uppercase anywhere —
UX-DESIGN's "tracked caps" section titles are retired).

Rules are numbered so they can be cited (`DL-3.2`). An agent editing chrome UI
must run the checklist in §9 before calling the work done.

## 0. Identity

> Stackgrid chrome reads like a well-kept config file: quiet rows of
> key → value set in the terminal's own colors. The terminal is the content;
> chrome recedes.

Everything below exists to serve that sentence and the app's founding
constraint: **consume as few machine resources as possible.**

## 1. Hard constraints (resource frugality)

- **DL-1.1** No new runtime dependencies for chrome UI. CSS + Preact only.
- **DL-1.2** Animate only `transform`, `opacity`, `color`, `border-color`,
  `background-color`. Max duration 300ms. No infinite / looping animations.
  Nothing animates while the user is idle.
- **DL-1.3** Banned: **blurred/offset** `box-shadow` (the app is a flat system —
  depth comes from background steps and 1px hairlines), `backdrop-filter`,
  `filter`, JS animation loops (`requestAnimationFrame`) for chrome, timers that
  exist only to drive visuals. `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px <color>` is
  permitted — it is a hairline, not a shadow (it paints no blur and costs no
  compositing layer).
- **DL-1.4** Prefer native inputs (`<select>`, `<input type="color">`) overlaid
  invisibly on a styled pill over custom dropdown/picker widgets — zero JS,
  zero extra DOM, free accessibility.
- **DL-1.5** Honor `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`: chrome transitions are
  disabled, panels appear instantly.

## 2. Tokens

Single source of truth: `:root` in `src/styles.css`. Theme colors are injected
from the active terminal theme (`--bg --fg --accent --red --green --yellow
--magenta --cyan`); everything else derives via `color-mix`:

| token                                              | role                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `--chrome-1` / `--chrome-2`                        | background steps for bars / panels |
| `--input-bg`                                       | recessed input surfaces            |
| `--hair` / `--hair-strong`                         | 1px structural hairlines           |
| `--text-primary` / `--text-muted` / `--text-faint` | text hierarchy                     |
| `--ui-font` / `--mono`                             | prose / data typefaces             |

- **DL-2.1** Components never hardcode colors. Every color routes through a
  token, or comes from the live theme object (e.g. swatches previewing a
  theme's own colors).
- **DL-2.2** The theme drives everything: switching theme must restyle all
  chrome with zero component changes.

## 3. Color roles (strict)

- **DL-3.1** `--accent` marks **interactive or active** only: hover/focus
  borders, focus ring, active markers, affordance hints. Never a decorative
  fill, never large areas.
- **DL-3.2** `--green` means only _on / enabled / success_. `--red` means only
  _danger / destructive / error_. Never decoration.
- **DL-3.3** Structure comes from `--hair` hairlines and background steps —
  not from color, not from shadows.
- **DL-3.4** Text hierarchy: `--text-primary` for keys and values,
  `--text-muted` for secondary value text (e.g. hex codes), `--text-faint` for
  descriptions, group labels, hints, disabled states.

## 4. Typography

- **DL-4.1** `--ui-font` for prose: keys, descriptions.
- **DL-4.2** `--mono` for **data**: every configurable value, group labels,
  paths, keyboard hints. Values always get `font-variant-numeric:
tabular-nums`.
- **DL-4.3** **No uppercase anywhere.** No `text-transform`. Letter-spacing on
  mono labels stays ≤ 0.06em.
- **DL-4.4** Sizes (px): group label 10.5 · key 12.5 · description 10.5 ·
  value 11.5 · panel title 12. Keys sentence-case, descriptions and values
  lowercase.

## 5. The one control: config row

Every setting is a **row**: key (+ optional one-line description) on the left,
exactly **one interactive value** on the right. No other widget genres — no
segmented controls, checkbox lists, chip grids, sliders, or boxed steppers.

```
cfg-group                     ← group label (mono, faint, lowercase)
cfg-row
├─ cfg-row__key
│  ├─ cfg-row__label          ← ui-font 12.5px primary
│  └─ cfg-row__desc           ← ui-font 10.5px faint (optional)
└─ cfg-row__value             ← right-aligned slot
   └─ cfg-btn …               ← the single interactive pill
```

- **DL-5.1** Row hover: 2px left accent bar + 4% `--fg` wash. Nothing else.
- **DL-5.2** The pill (`.cfg-btn`): mono value inside a 1px `--hair` border,
  radius 6px. Hover → `--hair-strong` border. Focus-visible → 2px `--accent`
  outline (app-wide convention). Disabled → `--text-faint`.
- **DL-5.3** Affordance glyphs (`↹` cycle, `▾` menu, `…` picker, `↺` reset)
  live inside the pill as `--text-faint`, turning `--accent` on pill hover.

## 6. Value kinds (closed set)

Extend **this table first** before inventing a new kind; a value that doesn't
fit is a design decision, not an implementation detail.

| kind     | looks like                   | interaction                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `cycle`  | `▪ tokyo-night ↹`            | click advances to the next option     |
| `menu`   | `JetBrains Mono ▾`           | invisible native `<select>` overlay   |
| `step`   | `− 14px +` in one pill       | −/+ zones inside the pill             |
| `color`  | `▪ #16161e`                  | invisible native color input overlay  |
| `picker` | `custom …`                   | opens a native OS dialog (file/image) |
| `toggle` | `on` (green) / `off` (faint) | click flips; `role="switch"`          |
| `action` | `↺ reset` (red for danger)   | click runs the action                 |

`picker` differs from `menu`: its source is a native OS dialog (e.g. an image
file), not a fixed `<select>` list. Its value reads `default` / `custom`; a
custom pick shows the `↺` clear button (DL-6.1); any failure shows inline via
`.cfg-custom--error` (DL-6.2).

- **DL-6.1** An overridden-from-default value may show a small `↺` clear
  button beside the pill — the only permitted second element in a value slot.
- **DL-6.2** A `menu` whose option list can't cover every case (font family,
  editor command) may open an **inline text row** under its own row
  (`.cfg-custom`) — never a modal, never a second pill. A `picker` surfaces its
  errors the same way, via `.cfg-custom--error`.
- **DL-6.3** Every text field uses `CommitInput`
  (`src/ui/controls/commit-input.tsx`): the draft lives in local state and
  commits on blur/Enter. A store-controlled `value={…}` input in the panel is a
  data-loss bug — the panel never unmounts, so any app re-render rewrites the
  DOM value and wipes what the user was typing.
- **DL-6.4** A pill holding several buttons (`step`) puts the focus ring on the
  focused button, not the pill; a pill wrapping one invisible native input
  (`menu`, `color`) puts it on the pill via `:focus-within`.

## 7. Motion budget (chrome)

- Panel slide-over: `transform` + `opacity`, 0.28s ease-out cubic (existing).
- State changes (hover/active): 0.13s ease.
- Nothing else moves. See DL-1.2 / DL-1.5.

## 8. Copy

- English UI. Keys sentence-case (`Show pane bar`); descriptions terse and
  lowercase (`reopen tabs on launch`); values lowercase mono (`on`, `off`,
  theme ids as written in code).
- A control says what happens; no vague labels.

## 9. Agent checklist (anti-drift)

Before shipping any chrome UI change:

1. Is it expressible as a config row (§5) using an existing value kind (§6)?
   If not — propose an edit to this document first, then implement. (This has
   already been violated once: a segmented control was added for "Tab bar
   position" and had to be rewritten as a `cycle`.)
2. Every color maps to a role in §3; no hardcoded hex (DL-2.1).
3. Any animation fits the budget in §7 and the constraints in §1. Reduced-motion
   is handled **by scope** (`.panel *`), never by an allowlist of class names —
   an allowlist silently misses the next class.
4. No uppercase, values in `--mono` (§4).
5. Text fields go through `CommitInput` (DL-6.3). Never bind a store value
   straight into `<input value=…>` inside the panel.
6. Eye-review on a rendered screenshot before calling it done — a green build
   proves nothing about design.

## 10. Migration status (what does NOT comply yet)

This document is the target, not a description of the whole app. Only the
settings panel has been reworked. Known survivors, to be fixed as each surface
is reworked — **do not "fix" them opportunistically inside an unrelated change**:

| where                                                                              | violates            | note                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `.tab-popover__label`                                                              | DL-4.3 (uppercase)  | rework with the tab popover           |
| `.search-bar`                                                                      | DL-1.3 (box-shadow) | real blurred shadow — drop            |
| `.workspace-row.is-selected`, `.preset-chip.is-selected`, `.mock-pane.is-selected` | —                   | inset hairlines, allowed under DL-1.3 |
