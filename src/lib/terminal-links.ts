 *  - `url`  — http/https, opened in the default browser
 *  - `path` — a file path, optionally suffixed `:line` or `:line:col`
 *
 * Path matching is deliberately loose (agents print bare relative paths like
 * `src/foo.ts:12`), so a candidate is only a *candidate*: the caller resolves
 * it against the pane's cwd and drops the ones that are not real files.
