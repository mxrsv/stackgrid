 *    advertises support — see pty.rs; Ghostty renders the same reports as its
 *    native progress bar). Once a pane has emitted one, it is the sole source
 *    of truth for that pane — non-zero state means working. Reports are
 *    parsed from EVERY chunk, even echo (Enter is input, and the busy report
 *    lands right behind it).
 * 2. A heuristic fallback for programs that never report progress
 *    (codex/gemini): working = a SUSTAINED stream of output — at least
 *    `minStreakMs` of continuous activity, still fresh within `recentMs` —
 *    where output arriving within `echoMs` of the user's own keystrokes is
 *    ignored (it's the TUI echoing input, not work), and a single isolated
 *    repaint (idle status refresh) never counts because its span is ~0ms.
 *
 * The caller gates this by "an agent runs in the pane" — a chatty shell job
 * doesn't reach the spinner because isAgent() is false for it.
